# brats-algorithms

Top performing algorithms from the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenges, providing state-of-the-art models for brain lesion segmentation.

## Features

- Access to top-performing algorithms from recent BraTS challenges.
- Easy-to-use inference API.
- Extensive documentation and examples. (TODO!)

## Installation

With a Python 3.10+ environment, you can install `PACKAGE_NAME` directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/PACKAGE_NAME/):

```sh
pip install PACKAGE_NAME
```

### Docker and NVIDIA Container Toolkit Setup

To run `PACKAGE_NAME` in a Docker container with GPU support (required for most algorithms), ensure you have Docker and NVIDIA Docker installed. Instructions:
- **Docker**: Installation instructions on the official [website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **NVIDIA Container Toolkit**: Installation instructions on the official [GitHub page](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit)
